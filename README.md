Forest Cover & CO₂ Emissions Analysis in India
Project Overview

This project performs exploratory time-series analysis on environmental indicators in India using World Bank datasets.

The study investigates:

Long-term forest cover trends

CO₂ emission growth

Correlation between environmental indicators

Spurious correlation in time-series data

Tools Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Key Findings

Forest area percentage remained relatively stable with gradual increases.

CO₂ emissions showed strong long-term growth.

Raw correlation was high (0.938), but differenced analysis revealed weaker short-term relationship.

Highlights importance of careful time-series interpretation.

Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning & transformation
