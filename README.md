# Forest Cover & CO₂ Emissions Analysis in India

## Project Overview
This project performs exploratory time-series analysis on environmental indicators in India using World Bank datasets.

The study focuses on:
- Forest area (% of land area)
- CO₂ emissions trends
- Normalized comparison of variables
- Correlation and spurious correlation analysis
- Moving average smoothing

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Key Findings
- Forest cover percentage remained relatively stable over time.
- CO₂ emissions showed significant long-term growth.
- Raw correlation (0.938) was high due to shared time trends.
- Differenced analysis revealed weaker short-term relationship.
- Demonstrates importance of careful time-series interpretation.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Time-series analysis
- Normalization techniques
- Correlation analysis
- Moving averages
- Statistical reasoning
